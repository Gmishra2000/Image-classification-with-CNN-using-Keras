# Image-classification-with-CNN-using-Keras
This is a project where I classify images using the concept of CNN and keras. In this I have made use of Cifar 10 dataset for image classification.
Futher improvisation can be made in this by choosing any other loss function and help to reduce the train and test time. You can also contribute according to your algorithms.
